**we can summarize markdown as a language that we use to describe our projects to the user in easy way, and with markdown we can create Headings ,Images ,Boxs and lists without tags.**

for example to create Heading we use #, and if we want to have a different levels of Heading we should start the lines with a #, and multiple ## in a row give us smaller Heading size
# The largest heading
## The second largest heading
###### The smallest heading.
And  if we want to add image to our project we should use !and [] and (), and to create ordered list we use dot with an number like this 1.like this
1. Hanady

But if we want to create unordered list we use * and - like this

* Hanady

with markdown we can do any things in easy way like if we want to create bold text we use ** before and after the text,like that **Hanady**.

To add alink we use [] and () like this
