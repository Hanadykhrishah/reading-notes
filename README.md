# reading-nots
we can summarize markdown as a language that we use to describe our projects to the user in easy way, and with markdown we can create Headings ,Images ,Boxs and lists without tags.

for example to create Heading we use #, and if we want to have a different levels of Heading we should start the lines with a #, and multiple ## in a row give us smaller Heading size
# The largest heading
## The second largest heading
###### The smallest heading.
AndÂ  if we want to add image to our project we should use !and [] and (), and to create ordered list we use dot with an number like this 1.like this
1. Hanady

But if we want to create unordered list we use * and - like this

* Hanady

with markdown we can do any things in easy way like if we want to create bold text we use ** before and after the text,like that **Hanady**.

To add alink we use [] and () like this
