**What is growth mindset?**

# *Growth mindset definition:*

**“A growth mindset is when students understand that their abilities can be developed,”**

 **People** ***are born with unique ~~genetic structures~~, meaning they are initially better than others at different things. However, those with a growth mindset believe that one can always improve, catch up, or even surpass others’ natural talents. This is where teachers play a crucial role in shaping a student’s confidence and outlook on school through productive,
 continuous feedback. It is crucial that “teachers who understand the growth mindset do everything in their power to unlock that learning***.
