# What is Git?
___
#### Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS), which means that every user creates a change on the file at hand, Git creates a copy of that file locally without the need to save them to a shared server, the thing that eleminates the possibility of losing data, in addition to the ability to work in your files even when you are offline or connected to a VPN.

### The local Git repository has three components:
* Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
* Index: The area used for staging (staging means flagging a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot).
* Head: Points to the most recent commit.
